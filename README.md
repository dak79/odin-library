## Description
This project is part of [The Odin Project - Full Stack JavaScript Path](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library).
This project had two stages: in the first stage Library app was using object and object constructors. In the second stage the code was refractured with `class` syntax. The main goal is to organize JavaScript code in Objects (later in class) and get some experience with prototype inheritance end OOP in JavaScript.

## Tecnologies
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Git

## Assignement
* First stage: 
    * Set up your project with skeleton HTML/CSS and JS files.
    * All of your book objects are going to be stored in a simple array, so add a function to the script (not the constructor) that can take user’s input and store the new book objects into an array. 
    * Write a function that loops through the array and displays each book on the page.
    * Add a “NEW BOOK” button that brings up a form allowing users to input the details for the new book: author, title, number of pages, whether it’s been read and anything else you might want.
    * Add a button on each book’s display to remove the book from the library.
    * You will need to associate your DOM elements with the actual book objects in some way. One easy solution is giving them a data-attribute that corresponds to the index of the library array.
    * Add a button on each book’s display to change its read status.
    * To facilitate this you will want to create the function that toggles a book’s read status on your Book prototype instance.
    * NOTE: You’re not required to add any type of storage right now. You will have the option to come back to this project later on in the course.

* Second stage:
    * Go back to your “Library” example and refactor it to use class instead of plain constructors. 
    * Don’t forget to use the git workflow (branches) you learned in this foundations lesson to work on a new feature. You should get used to working like this!
